# How to Download All Files from Replit

## Method 1: Replit's Download Feature (Easiest)

**Look for these options in your Replit interface:**

1. **Three dots menu (⋯)** - Usually near your project name at the top
   - Click the three dots → "Download as zip"

2. **File menu** - In the top menu bar
   - Look for "File" → "Download" or "Export"

3. **Right-click on project name** - In the file tree on the left
   - Right-click on your project folder → "Download"

4. **Settings gear icon** - Usually in the top right

## Method 2: If Download Option Isn't Visible

Sometimes the download option is in:
- **Share menu** → "Download"
- **Deployment menu** → "Export"
- **Tools menu** → "Export project"
