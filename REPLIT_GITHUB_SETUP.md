# Replit to GitHub Integration Guide

## Since git commands are blocked, use Replit's built-in GitHub integration:

### Method 1: Replit's GitHub Integration
1. Look for a **GitHub icon** or **Version Control** button in Replit's left sidebar
2. Or look for "Connect to GitHub" in the main menu
3. Or check if there's a "Deploy" or "Share" button that connects to GitHub

### Method 2: Use Replit's Built-in Export
1. Look for these options in Replit:
   - Three dots menu (⋯) → "Connect to GitHub" 
   - File menu → "Connect to GitHub"
   - Settings → "GitHub Integration"
   - "Deploy" button → GitHub option

### Method 3: Manual Repository Creation
If the above don't work, go to GitHub directly:

1. Go to https://github.com/fjmurias
2. Click "New repository" 
3. Name it "slingfantasy"
4. Add description: "Ryan's Sports Challenge 2026 - Multi-sport fantasy league platform"
5. Create repository
6. Use "Upload files" to add your Replit code
